# MetaMuseum
Features:
1. User Authentication
2. Admin Dashboard
3. 3D Virtual Gallery
Developed using 3.js to display art interactively in a 3D environment.
Navigation features: walkthrough, zoom, and rotate.
Theme customization based on user preferences.
4. Emotion Detection Module
Accepts user input (text, image, or audio).
Utilizes sentiment/emotion analysis to determine mood.
Interfaces with art recommendation logic.
5. Art Recommendation System
Uses the Harvard Art Museums API to fetch and recommend art based on emotion.
Categorization of art (e.g., paintings, sculptures).
Display art details: artist, title, creation year, and description.
